            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>

            <li>1 tsp. dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. hot red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 can (28oz) tomatoes in puree, tomatoes coarsely chopped and puree reserved</li>
            <li>1lb penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded fontina or mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into bite-size pieces, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Stir in the basil, oregano and red pepper flakes. Add the tomatoes and puree and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350ÂºF. Lightly oil a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot three-fourths full of water to a boil over high heat. Salt the water, add the pasta, stir well and cook until barely al dente (tender but firm to the bite), 10 to 12 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss the pasta with the sauce, the ricotta and fontina. Spread in the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheeses are melted and the tips of the pasta are crusty, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
